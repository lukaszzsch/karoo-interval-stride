# Design history

One folder per feature: a README with what was agreed, sketches (`.html`, open in a browser)
and screenshots from the Karoo 3 (`device/`). Newest work first.

| `onboarding/` | First-run introduction: connect, look, add to a ride profile, tap the watts |

| `power-gauge/` | 5th watts option: gauge arc, target range on top, Lap avg / HR tiles |
| `jump-flow/` | "Next up" box, choosing a jump, Confirm move (right), countdown |
| `target-toggle/` | Tap the Target tile: Target ↔ Target range |

`_wrap.py` turns a sketch snippet into a standalone HTML page.
